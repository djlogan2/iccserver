Properties:

Internal data:
  (chess.js) - An object that holds official board state, and manages rules regarding legal moves

State data:
  [most information is kept in the chess object]
  Taken pieces (which isn't in the chess object we have, although we could calculate it, or perhaps extend off of it)
  White and black clock
  Which player is top/bottom (i.e. flip value)
  Source square clicked (for drag or click/click)
  Game type (normal, atomic, etc.)

Subcomponents:
  Board

Authorities and roles:

  Private examining: allow_private_examine
  Examine at all: examine_games
  Adding/removing examiners: override_examiners

  Change game data (i.e. names, elos) - change_(gametype)_game_data
  Change clocks
     - Outright resetting: change_(gametype)_clocks
     - More time:  moretime_(gametype)

  Make normal legal forward moves on the board
    - In a game, the players
    - Examine
        -   "General" examine
        -   Lessons
        -   Broadcasts

  Clear board, set pieces
  "Examine" type moves - forward, backward, revert, etc. (override_examine_moves)

  One would also assume that there are classes of games (i.e. played, tournament, lessons, general examine)
  Aborting (override_game_abort, override_examine_abort)
           allow_(gametype)_abort

Legacy messages (and probably also meteor reactive messages too)
  game start and end
  moves, draw offers, abort offers, resigns
  clock updates
  users observing start/end
  kibitzes and whispers

Descriptions and expectations:
  Drag vs click/click?
  Premove?
  We will have to figure out how to write new versions of the chess.js above over time in order to support various
       other types of chess
  User setting to require opponents to request more time
  Engine use - Think about "feature" roles, or authorities on a game basis or whatever

Things to keep in mind:
  Think about X number of draws per...
  Think about allowing the "local" drawing on a board with the opportunity to save those as part of the game data during game play
  Local vs server drawing
  How to change board/pieces
